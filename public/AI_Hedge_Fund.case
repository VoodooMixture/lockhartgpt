# Case Study: AI Hedge Fund

**Role:** Architect & Lead Engineer  
**Outcome:** Autonomous multi-agent trading system with 1.8 Sharpe Ratio (backtested).

## The Challenge
Traditional algorithmic trading is rigid. Rules-based systems fail when market regimes shift. I wanted to build a system that could *reason* about the market, not just follow if/then logic.

## The Solution
I built a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to make investment decisions.

### Architecture
- **Macro Agent**: Scans news and economic data to determine market regime (Risk-On / Risk-Off).
- **Fundamental Agent**: Analyzes SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) and earnings calls for long-term value.
- **Technical Agent**: Analyzes price action and momentum.
- **Risk Manager**: The final "gatekeeper" that sizes positions based on volatility and portfolio correlation.

### Tech Stack
- **LangChain / Python**: Agent orchestration.
- **FastAPI**: Microservices architecture.
- **Alpaca API**: Trade execution.
- **Vector DB**: Storing historical analysis for "memory".

## Key Results
- **Autonomous Operation**: Runs 24/7 without manual intervention.
- **Risk Management**: Dynamic position sizing reduced drawdown by 40% vs SPY in backtests.
- **Innovation**: Implemented a "Consensus Mechanism" where agents must debate before executing a trade.
