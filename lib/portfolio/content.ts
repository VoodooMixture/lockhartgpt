**Systems-Driven Leader & AI Engineer**

I bridge the gap between **Operations**, **Finance**, and **Engineering**.
My career has evolved from Investment Banking (M&A) to Founding/Scaling Ops-heavy ventures ($5M+ raised), to now building autonomous AI agents.

## Core Value Prop
1.  **Founder Mindset**: I don't just write code; I build businesses. I've raised capital, managed P&Ls, and led cross-functional teams.
2.  **Ops-First Engineering**: I build software to solve real operational bottlenecks, not just for the sake of tech.
3.  **Financial Rigor**: My background in M&A means I optimize for ROI and capital efficiency in every architectural decision.

## Experience Highlights
*   **Fathom Cannabis (COO)**: Raised $5M, built a commercial facility, and used data/regression models to cut op costs by 40%.
*   **Standard Cannabis (Founder)**: Engineered custom extraction tech and managed global supply chains.
*   **Top Hat Photo Booths (Founder)**: Bootstrapped to $1M+ revenue with a custom SQL-based booking platform.
*   **Fox-Pitt Kelton (Analyst)**: M&A and Valuation modeling for financial institutions.

## Tech Stack
*   **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, SQL, Go
*   **Data/AI**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, OpenAI API, LangChain
*   **Web**: Next.js, Tailwind, React, Node.js
*   **Tools**: Tableau, AWS, Excel (Advanced Modeling)

    "Fathom_Cannabis.case": `# Case Study: Fathom Cannabis (2018-2025)
**Role**: Owner / Founder / COO
**Outcome**: Secured $5M financing, built commercial facility, reduced OpEx by 40%.

## The Challenge
Scaling a complex, regulated cultivation facility required precise environmental control and strict capital efficiency. Off-the-shelf solutions were expensive and generic.

## The Solution
1.  **Capital Strategy**: Led the development of comprehensive financial models and pitch decks to secure **$5M in debt and equity**.
2.  **Tech-Enabled Ops**: Developed robust **regression models** to analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), identifying levers to reduce energy and labor costs.
3.  **Infrastructure**: Managed the build-out of a high-tech greenhouse, incorporating proprietary design elements that minimized carbon footprint.

## Tech & Skills Used
*   **Financial Modeling**: Complex operational pro formas for investors.
*   **Data Analysis**: Regression modeling for yield optimization.
*   **Operations Management**: Hired and trained a staff of 30+; managed full employee lifecycle.

    "Standard_Cannabis.case": `# Case Study: Standard Cannabis (2014-2018)
**Role**: Owner / Founder
**Focus**: Engineering & Global Supply Chain

## Innovation
Recognized safety gaps in the industry and founded a business to professionalize extraction technology.

## Key Achievements
*   **Hardware Engineering**: Led the design and fabrication of botanical extraction machines using supercritical CO2 and light hydrocarbons.
*   **Global Sourcing**: Spearheaded sourcing initiatives for machine parts, ensuring cost-effectiveness and timely procurement.
*   **Process Optimization**: Developed SOPs for molecular distillation and separation processes.

## Impact
Created a safer, more efficient extraction standard that was adopted by licensees, driving product quality and safety.

    "TopHat_Photo.case": `# Case Study: Top Hat Photo Booths (2010-2014)
**Role**: Owner / Founder
**Outcome**: Bootstrapped to profitability in Year 1, $1M+ Revenue.

## The "Engineer" Moment
I didn't just run the business; I built the system that made it scale. Manual booking was a bottleneck, so I automated it.

## The Tech
*   **Custom SQL Database**: Architected a database to house all booking and event information securely.
*   **Booking System Integration**: Integrated the custom DB with accounting software to automate clerical tasks.
*   **Result**: Reduced admin time by 50% and eliminated booking errors.

## Business Growth
*   Expanded to 15+ cities along the East Coast and Midwest.
*   Clients included **Google, Microsoft, Dolce & Gabbana**.
*   Personally built the initial photo booth hardware and software interfaces.

    "Finance_Analyst.case": `# Experience: Fox-Pitt Kelton (2008-2009)
**Role**: Investment Banking Analyst
**Domain**: M&A and Capital Raising for Financial Institutions

## The Foundation
Before engineering, I learned the language of business: **Finance**.

## Responsibilities
*   **Valuation**: Developed DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) and LBO models.
*   **M&A**: Created detailed pitchbooks and operating models for potential acquisition targets.
*   **Capital Markets**: Assisted with roadshow presentations for a $105M follow-on offering (NASDAQ: ESGR).

## Why This Matters Today
This background ensures that every line of code I write generates business value. I don't build "cool tech"; I build assets that yield ROI.

    "Automation_Agent.case": `# Case Study: AI Automation
**Role**: Architect
**Outcome**: Automated workflows using Agentic AI.

## Agentic Workflows
Building autonomous agents that can:
1.  **Research**: Scrape and synthesize web data (like QuiverQuant or EDGAR).
2.  **Plan**: Break down complex objectives into executable steps.
3.  **Execute**: Write code, run tests, and deploy software.

This portfolio itself is a testament to that capability, acting as a virtual clone that can reason about my own history.
